# SMARTVIEW: Monitoring of Proper School Uniform and Standard Hair Color of Students Using Machine Learning Technique

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning technique to monitor student uniform compliance in Batangas State University. By analyzing images captured through surveillance cameras or other sources, the system can detect whether students are adhering to uniform policies. This can help schools and colleges maintain discipline and ensure a conducive learning environment.

## Features

- **Uniform Detection**: Utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify whether students are wearing the prescribed uniform.
- **Real-time Monitoring and Counting**: Capable of monitoring students in real-time, allowing for immediate intervention if non-compliance is detected.
- **Customizable**: The system can be customized to suit the specific uniform requirements of different institutions.
- **Scalable**: Designed to scale with the size of the institution, capable of handling large volumes of data and multiple surveillance feeds.
